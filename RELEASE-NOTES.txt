ABOUT LEOS
==================================================================================================

    LEOS is a software that was created under ISA Action 2016.38 Legislation Interoperability 
Tools - LegIT to address the need of the public administration and European Institutions to 
generate draft legislation in a legal XML format.
    
    It is a legislation editor and this current prototype supports the drafting of the 'secondary' 
legislation of the EU law which has to be adopted under the Ordinary Legislative Procedure. 

    Therefore, it covers the writing of Proposals for Directive, Decision and Regulation 
submitted by the Commission to the Council and the Parliament.

    If you want to find out more about this procedure, please read the European Parliament's 
article.
http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers

    Given the high diversity of legislative traditions encountered across the Union and the 
different levels of modernisation, it was extremely difficult to provide a universal single 
turnkey ICT solution that adapts to each specific context.

    Even if a significant part of the business logic can be found embedded in the code, we design 
with the goal of delivering re-usable building blocks so LEOS is released Open Source as we 
believe that some parts of it could be reused and adapted by some other Public Administration
having similar needs.

    For more information on the features please follow us on Joinup:
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/leos-open-source-software-editing-legislation

    The code is available for free under EUPL licence, and the development team paid attention to 
organise the code in a structured way to ease its reusability (modules, plugins…).

    The LEOS demo provided in our release comes with an example user interface that includes the logo of the European Commission. 
This is just for demonstration purpose and please note that the logo of the European Commission may be used by third parties only if:
-  Permission is requested and granted before the logo is used
-  There is no likelihood of the user of the logo being confused with the European Commission
-  It is not used in connection with objectives or activities which are incompatible with the aims and principles of the European Commission
-  It is not used to imply or suggest unintended endorsement or promotion of the objectives and activities of the user of the logo by the European Commission

WHAT'S NEW?
==================================================================================================
What’s new?
This Beta version is currently used for a pilot across the Commission services. The main 
differences compared to the previous prototype version are:
-  Possible to add comments & highligts using annotations
-  Possible to add suggestions on a part of text with the feature to accept and reject 
a suggestion
-  Improved version management, with major versions and possibility to see differences between versions
-  Improved table of content edition


WHAT'S GONE?

Nothing this time :-)


GET IN TOUCH
==================================================================================================

    We are envisaging to create an open source community on software for legislation drafting, 
in order to share best practices, experiences, expertise, and why not code!!
Should you be interested or would you just like to share with us some observations on our 
work, you can join the conversation one legislative drafting here

OR contact us at DIGIT-LEOS-FEEDBACK@ec.europa.eu .

We are looking forward to hearing from you,
